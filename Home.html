    <h4><p style="color: rgb(95, 46, 46);">When I first stepped into the gym, I was unsure, inexperienced, and honestly, a little intimidated. I didn’t know how to lift properly, how to eat for growth, or even what I was truly capable of — but I knew one thing: I wanted to change. I wanted to be stronger, more confident, and proud of what I saw in the mirror. The early days were full of sore muscles, failed reps, and moments where quitting felt easier than continuing. But something inside me refused to give up. I kept showing up, even when progress was invisible. I learned, I adapted, and I grew — not just physically, but mentally. I studied training methods, dialed in my nutrition, and became disciplined with sleep and recovery. Each day, each rep, and each clean meal added up. I watched as my body slowly began to transform — the fat melted away, muscle took its place, and my strength skyrocketed. More importantly, I became someone who didn’t just chase results, but chased improvement. Bodybuilding taught me that growth isn’t about perfection, it’s about persistence. It’s about waking up tired and going anyway. It’s about lifting heavier not just for the weight, but because you’ve become mentally tougher. Now, looking back at where I started, I don’t just see progress — I see purpose. This journey has given me discipline, confidence, and a sense of control over my life I never thought possible. And I know this is only the beginning.</p></h4>
